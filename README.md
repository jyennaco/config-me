config-me
=========

Repository for basic configuration settings such as gitignore and svnignore.  This is primarily intended for Mac or Linux workstation configuration, but there may be some useful stuff for server configuration as well.

Since this is workstation focused, I assume the scripts are not being run as root and may require sudo password entry one time per script (if required).
